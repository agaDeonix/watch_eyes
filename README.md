## Introduction

Eye Watch is an Android application for Wear OS that allows users to customize their watch face with eyes from famous films, anime, and various other sources. Paired with a companion app, users can control the look and movement of the eye on their watch. This project is built using Kotlin, Jetpack Compose for the UI, and custom animations.
